PURPOSE:
    The purpose of this project is to reconstruct a posterior distribution given only a scaled version of it. 
    I develop a method where, after sampling the chebyshev points, a polynomial is interpolated then integrated,
    scaled, and used as an approximation of the posterior distribution. 

    The method is evaluated against a histogram of the sampled values from the Metropolis algorithm (which is also 
    implemented here).

FILES:
    Dataset_Management_Class.py: 
        Creates a distribution given a set of parameters. Provides functions to access
        and work with the distribution.
    Chebyshev_Class.py: 
        Implements Chebyshev interpolation and stores the interpolant
    Metropolis_Class.py:
        implements Metropolis algorithm and returns the samples
    Method_Comparison.py:
        Computes l1 error for Metropolis histogram and Chebyshev interpolation to the target distribution 
        and visualizes their representations.
    Main.py:
        Runs the experiment comparing Metropolis histogram and Chebyshev interpolation to the target distribution.
